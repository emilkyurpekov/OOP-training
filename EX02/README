This task defines a class Employee that holds the following information:
name, salary, position, department, email, and age. The name, salary, position, and department are mandatory, while the rest are optional.  
My  task was to write a program that takes N lines of information about employees from the console and calculates the department with the highest average salary, 
and prints for each employee in that department his name, salary, email, and age - sorted by salary in descending order. If an employee doesn't have an email – 
in place of that field, it prints "n/a" instead, if he doesn't have an age – print "-1" instead.
