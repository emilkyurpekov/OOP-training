This is the first problem that has been given to me as a student. The program creates a Person class with two fields String name and int age. 
The programreads from the console N lines of personal information and then prints all people whose age is more than 30 years,
sorted in alphabetical order.Printed in the following format "{name} â€“ {age}"
